We Love Movies

We Love Movies is a website where a user is able to see different movies and different theaters that premiere those movies. They are able to look at individual movies and see a complete description of them. They are also able to see the reviews and able to delete those reviews.

This project is designed to test my ability to both build complex servers and access data through a database. To succeed at this project, I'll need to demonstrate you can do the following:

    Install and use common middleware packages.
    Receive requests through routes.
    Running tests from the command line.
    Access relevant information through route and query parameters.
    Create an error handler for the case where a route does not exist.
    Build an API following RESTful design principles.
    Create and customize a knexfile.js file.
    Create a connection to your database with Knex.
    Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server.
    Return joined and nested data with Knex.
    Write database migrations using Knex's migration tools.
    Deploy your backend server to a cloud service.
